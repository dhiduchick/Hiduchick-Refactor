 ## About the Project 
 In this challenge we were provided a started code of a website and a user story that included things we needed to change about the code and add the new cababilities the user was requesting.

 ## Usage and Updates  
The website provides explinations on serch engine optimization, online reputation managment, and social media marketing. the changes i added to these sections were including 'alt' text to the minages that was the website its accesible to all who wish to use it as stated in the acceptance criteria. The oage also includes descriptions on lead generation, brand awareness, and cost management. These sections also include images that needed 'alt' text to adhere to acessability standards. Within the started code there were many 'div' sections that could be replaceed with more efficent and sematic HTML elements such as 'section', 'article', and 'figure'. The title of the website when first opening the started code was 'website' in the acceptance criteria I was asked to make sure there was a clean and concise title, I then changed the title to 'Horiseon Social Solution Services' to make sure the user knoew exactl what they were engaging in when they entered the website.
